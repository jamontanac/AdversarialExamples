It deals with two significant issues in the pre-processing process (i). issues with data and (ii). Steps to follow to do data analysis with its best approach. As raw data are vulnerable to noise, corruption, missing, and inconsistent data, it is necessary to perform pre-processing steps, which is done using classification, clustering, and association and many other pre-processing techniques available. Poor data can primarily affect the accuracy and lead to false prediction, so it is necessary to improve the dataset's quality. So, data pre-processing is the best way to deal with such problems. It makes the knowledge extraction from the data set much easier with cleaning, Integration, transformation, and reduction methods. The issue with Data missing and significant differences in the variety of data always exists as the information is collected through multiple sources and from a real-world application. So, the data augmentation approach generates data for machine learning models. To decrease the dependency on training data and to improve the performance of the machine learning model. This paper discusses flipping, rotating with slight degrees and others to augment the image data and shows how to perform data augmentation methods without distorting the original data.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks are highly expressive models that have recently achieved state of the art performance on speech and visual recognition tasks. While their expressiveness is the reason they succeed, it also causes them to learn uninterpretable solutions that could have counter-intuitive properties. In this paper we report two such properties. First, we find that there is no distinction between individual high level units and random linear combinations of high level units, according to various methods of unit analysis. It suggests that it is the space, rather than the individual units, that contains of the semantic information in the high layers of neural networks. Second, we find that deep neural networks learn input-output mappings that are fairly discontinuous to a significant extend. We can cause the network to misclassify an image by applying a certain imperceptible perturbation, which is found by maximizing the network's prediction error. In addition, the specific nature of these perturbations is not a random artifact of learning: the same perturbation can cause a different network, that was trained on a different subset of the dataset, to misclassify the same input.},

We argue instead that the primary cause of neural networks' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear nature. This explanation is supported by new quantitative results while giving the first explanation of the most intriguing fact about them: their generalization across architectures and training sets. Moreover, this view yields a simple and fast method of generating adversarial examples.

Currently, a large number of researches on defending adversarial examples pay little attention to the real-world applications, either with high computational complexity or poor defensive effects. Motivated by this observation, we develop an efficient preprocessing method to defend adversarial images. Specifically, before an adversarial example is fed into the model, we perform two image transformations: WebP compression, which is utilized to remove the small adversarial noises. Flip operation, which flips the image once along one side of the image to destroy the specific structure of adversarial perturbations. Finally, a de-perturbed sample is obtained and can be correctly classified by DNNs. Experimental results on ImageNet show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art defense methods. It can effectively defend adversarial attacks while ensure only very small accuracy drop on normal images.},

	abstract = {Neural networks provide state-of-the-art results for most machine learning tasks. Unfortunately, neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: given an input \$x\$ and any target classification \$t\$, it is possible to find a new input \$x'\$ that is similar to \$x\$ but classified as \$t\$. This makes it difficult to apply neural networks in security-critical areas. Defensive distillation is a recently proposed approach that can take an arbitrary neural network, and increase its robustness, reducing the success rate of current attacks' ability to find adversarial examples from \$95{\textbackslash}\%\$ to \$0.5{\textbackslash}\%\$. In this paper, we demonstrate that defensive distillation does not significantly increase the robustness of neural networks by introducing three new attack algorithms that are successful on both distilled and undistilled neural networks with \$100{\textbackslash}\%\$ probability. Our attacks are tailored to three distance metrics used previously in the literature, and when compared to previous adversarial example generation algorithms, our attacks are often much more effective (and never worse). Furthermore, we propose using high-confidence adversarial examples in a simple transferability test we show can also be used to break defensive distillation. We hope our attacks will be used as a benchmark in future defense attempts to create neural networks that resist adversarial examples.},

	abstract = {Deep learning algorithms have been shown to perform extremely well on many classical machine learning problems. However, recent studies have shown that deep learning, like other machine learning techniques, is vulnerable to adversarial samples: inputs crafted to force a deep neural network (DNN) to provide adversary-selected outputs. Such attacks can seriously undermine the security of the system supported by the DNN, sometimes with devastating consequences. For example, autonomous vehicles can be crashed, illicit or illegal content can bypass content filters, or biometric authentication systems can be manipulated to allow improper access. In this work, we introduce a defensive mechanism called defensive distillation to reduce the effectiveness of adversarial samples on DNNs. We analytically investigate the generalizability and robustness properties granted by the use of defensive distillation when training DNNs. We also empirically study the effectiveness of our defense mechanisms on two DNNs placed in adversarial settings. The study shows that defensive distillation can reduce effectiveness of sample creation from 95\% to less than 0.5\% on a studied DNN. Such dramatic gains can be explained by the fact that distillation leads gradients used in adversarial sample creation to be reduced by a factor of 10{\textasciicircum}30. We also find that distillation increases the average minimum number of features that need to be modified to create adversarial samples by about 800\% on one of the DNNs we tested.},

Our proposal leverages the integration of ensemble learning to realistic network environments, by combining layers of detectors devoted to monitor the behavior of the applications employed by the organization. Our proposal is validated through extensive experiments performed in heterogeneous network settings simulating botnet detection scenarios, and consider detectors based on distinct machine- and deep-learning algorithms. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of AppCon in mitigating the dangerous threat of adversarial attacks in over 75\% of the considered evasion attempts, while not being affected by the limitations of existing countermeasures, such as performance degradation in non-adversarial settings.

We show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which resemble those found in the human visual cortex. Using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be done in reasonable time. A second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. We created two sets of reliable labels. The CIFAR-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 set has 600 examples of each of 100 non-overlapping classes. Using these labels, we show that object recognition is signicantly improved by pre-training a layer of features on a large set of unlabeled tiny images.},

Using our methodology we explore the structure aspect of network design and arrive at a low-dimensional design space consisting of simple, regular networks that we call RegNet. The core insight of the RegNet parametrization is surprisingly simple: widths and depths of good networks can be explained by a quantized linear function. We analyze the RegNet design space and arrive at interesting findings that do not match the current practice of network design. The RegNet design space provides simple and fast networks that work well across a wide range of flop regimes.

To address this problem, we study the adversarial robustness of neural networks through the lens of robust optimization. This approach provides us with a broad and unifying view on much of the prior work on this topic. Its principled nature also enables us to identify methods for both training and attacking neural networks that are reliable and, in a certain sense, universal. In particular, they specify a concrete security guarantee that would protect against any adversary. These methods let us train networks with significantly improved resistance to a wide range of adversarial attacks. They also suggest the notion of security against a first-order adversary as a natural and broad security guarantee. We believe that robustness against such well-defined classes of adversaries is an important stepping stone towards fully resistant deep learning models.

	abstract = {It is well known that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples. We attempt to understand adversarial examples from the perspective of frequency analysis. Several works have empirically shown that the gradient-based adversarial attacks perform differently in the low-frequency and high-frequency part of the input data. But there is still a lack of theoretical justification of these phenomena. In this work, we both theoretically and empirically show that the adversarial perturbations gradually increase the concentration in the low-frequency domain of the spectrum during the training process of the model parameters. And the log-spectrum difference of the adversarial examples and clean image is more concentrated in the high-frequency part than the low-frequency part. We also find out that the ratio of the high-frequency and the low-frequency part in the adversarial perturbation is much larger than that in the corresponding natural image. Inspired by these important theoretical findings, we apply low-pass filter to potential adversarial examples before feeding them to the model. The results show that this preprocessing can significantly improve the robustness of the model.},

Namely, a deep neural network can be interpreted using a partial differential equation, which naturally inspires us to characterize ResNet by an explicit Euler method. Our analytical studies reveal that the step factor h in the Euler method is able to control the robustness of ResNet in both its training and generalization. Specifically, we prove that a small step factor h can benefit the training robustness for back-propagation; from the view of forward-propagation, a small h can aid in the robustness of the model generalization. A comprehensive empirical evaluation on both vision CIFAR-10 and text AG-NEWS datasets confirms that a small h aids both the training and generalization robustness.},

	abstract = {The ResNet and its variants have achieved remarkable successes in various computer vision tasks. Despite its success in making gradient flow through building blocks, the simple shortcut connection mechanism limits the ability of re-exploring new potentially complementary features due to the additive function. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose to introduce a regulator module as a memory mechanism to extract complementary features, which are further fed to the ResNet. In particular, the regulator module is composed of convolutional RNNs (e.g., Convolutional LSTMs or Convolutional GRUs), which are shown to be good at extracting Spatio-temporal information. We named the new regulated networks as RegNet. The regulator module can be easily implemented and appended to any ResNet architecture. We also apply the regulator module for improving the Squeeze-and-Excitation ResNet to show the generalization ability of our method. Experimental results on three image classification datasets have demonstrated the promising performance of the proposed architecture compared with the standard ResNet, SE-ResNet, and other state-of-the-art architectures.},

The existing deep learning algorithms cannot effectively describe the essential characteristics of data, making the algorithm unable to give the correct result in the face of malicious input. Based on current security threats faced by deep learning, this paper introduces the problem of adversarial examples in deep learning, sorts out the existing attack and defense methods of the black box and white box, and classifies them. It briefly describes the application of some adversarial examples in different scenarios in recent years, compares several defense technologies of adversarial examples, and finally summarizes the problems in this research field and prospects for its future development. This paper introduces the common white box attack methods in detail, and further compares the similarities and differences between the attack of the black and white box. Correspondingly, the author also introduces the defense methods, and analyzes the performance of these methods against the black and white box attack.},

Currently, deep learning architectures are showing better performance compared to the shallow or traditional models. Deep ensemble learning models combine the advantages of both the deep learning models as well as the ensemble learning such that the final model has better generalization performance. This paper reviews the state-of-art deep ensemble models and hence serves as an extensive summary for the researchers. The ensemble models are broadly categorised into bagging, boosting, stacking, negative correlation based deep ensemble models, explicit/implicit ensembles, homogeneous/heterogeneous ensemble, decision fusion strategies based deep ensemble models. Applications of deep ensemble models in different domains are also briefly discussed. Finally, we conclude this paper with some potential future research directions.},

	abstract = {Adversarial examples are perturbed inputs designed to fool machine learning models. Adversarial training injects such examples into training data to increase robustness. To scale this technique to large datasets, perturbations are crafted using fast single-step methods that maximize a linear approximation of the model's loss. We show that this form of adversarial training converges to a degenerate global minimum, wherein small curvature artifacts near the data points obfuscate a linear approximation of the loss. The model thus learns to generate weak perturbations, rather than defend against strong ones. As a result, we find that adversarial training remains vulnerable to black-box attacks, where we transfer perturbations computed on undefended models, as well as to a powerful novel single-step attack that escapes the non-smooth vicinity of the input data via a small random step. We further introduce Ensemble Adversarial Training, a technique that augments training data with perturbations transferred from other models. On ImageNet, Ensemble Adversarial Training yields models with strong robustness to black-box attacks. In particular, our most robust model won the first round of the NIPS 2017 competition on Defenses against Adversarial Attacks. However, subsequent work found that more elaborate black-box attacks could significantly enhance transferability and reduce the accuracy of our models.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) models, e.g., deep neural networks (DNNs), are vulnerable to adversarial examples: malicious inputs modified to yield erroneous model outputs, while appearing unmodified to human observers. Potential attacks include having malicious content like malware identified as legitimate or controlling vehicle behavior. Yet, all existing adversarial example attacks require knowledge of either the model internals or its training data. We introduce the first practical demonstration of an attacker controlling a remotely hosted DNN with no such knowledge. Indeed, the only capability of our black-box adversary is to observe labels given by the DNN to chosen inputs. Our attack strategy consists in training a local model to substitute for the target DNN, using inputs synthetically generated by an adversary and labeled by the target DNN. We use the local substitute to craft adversarial examples, and find that they are misclassified by the targeted DNN. To perform a real-world and properly-blinded evaluation, we attack a DNN hosted by MetaMind, an online deep learning API. We find that their DNN misclassifies 84.24\% of the adversarial examples crafted with our substitute. We demonstrate the general applicability of our strategy to many ML techniques by conducting the same attack against models hosted by Amazon and Google, using logistic regression substitutes. They yield adversarial examples misclassified by Amazon and Google at rates of 96.19\% and 88.94\%. We also find that this black-box attack strategy is capable of evading defense strategies previously found to make adversarial example crafting harder.},

ML is now pervasive---new systems and models are being deployed in every domain imaginable, leading to rapid and widespread deployment of software based inference and decision making. There is growing recognition that ML exposes new vulnerabilities in software systems, yet the technical community's understanding of the nature and extent of these vulnerabilities remains limited. We systematize recent findings on ML security and privacy, focusing on attacks identified on these systems and defenses crafted to date. We articulate a comprehensive threat model for ML, and categorize attacks and defenses within an adversarial framework. Key insights resulting from works both in the ML and security communities are identified and the effectiveness of approaches are related to structural elements of ML algorithms and the data used to train them. We conclude by formally exploring the opposing relationship between model accuracy and resilience to adversarial manipulation. Through these explorations, we show that there are (possibly unavoidable) tensions between model complexity, accuracy, and resilience that must be calibrated for the environments in which they will be used.},
